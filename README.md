# Data Structures Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures Practice repository. This repository contains implementations and explanations of various data structures that I have practiced. Each data structure is implemented in C++ and is accompanied by a brief description and example usage.

## Array

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.

- **Features**:
  - Fixed size
  - Elements can be accessed randomly using indices
  - Efficient for index-based operations

[Array Implementation](array)

## Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

- **Types**:
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List

[Linked List Implementation](Linked list)

## Stack

A stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out).

- **Operations**:
  - Push
  - Pop
  - Peek/Top
  - isEmpty

## Queue

A queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

- **Types**:
  - Simple Queue
  - Circular Queue
  - Priority Queue
  - Deque (Double Ended Queue)

[Queue Implementation](Queue)

## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

- **Types**:
  - Full Binary Tree
  - Complete Binary Tree
  - Perfect Binary Tree
  - Balanced Binary Tree
  - Degenerate Tree

## Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree in which all the nodes follow the below properties:
- The left subtree of a node has a key less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node has a key greater than the node's key.

## Heap

A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. The heap is of two types:
- Max-Heap
- Min-Heap

[Heap Implementation](Heap)

## Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Graph

A graph is a data structure that consists of a finite set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges connecting them. Graphs can be:
- Directed or Undirected
- Weighted or Unweighted
